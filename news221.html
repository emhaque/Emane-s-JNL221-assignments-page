		<h2>"I hate it here" typically a result of an increased workload</h2>
		<p class="subhed">Zach Kopelman claimed to hate Syracuse University more to his friends and roommate when his workload was heavier</p>
		<p class="byline">Zach Kopelman</p>
		
		<p>Zach Kopelman said the phrase “I hate it here” quite often during the first semester of this academic year in reference to his general distaste for Syracuse university in a light and joking manner. His roommate and friends wondered if this was a symptom of tougher work days, and started taking note of every time he said the phrase. This data shows the use of the phrase throughout the month of February paired with the number of assignments he had due that day or in the coming days.</p>

		<p class="byline">John Perik</p>
		
		<p>Students who spend less time playing the new game “Word-lay” records increasingly lower test scores per week. Students who spend more time playing the game show a higher percentage of academic success. The extreme increase in academic success begins at the 2 hour (per week) mark. Scores first reach 100% on average when respondents record an average of 3 hours per week playing Word-lay. The scores remain at 100% for the rest of the respondents and at no point see a decline in average test scores.</p>

Unfortunately, player X suffered a severe wrist injury midway through his career which severely hindered his ability to give proper high fives.

As Jack advanced through school he was gradually given more and more homework assignments. These stress-inducing tasks have slowly but surely driven Jack to insanity. He hopes to maintain the small sliver of sanity he has left throughout college.</p>

		<p>An analysis of the amount of times Annie Klaff has visited various types of restaurants over the years is presented in this line chart. Four types of restaurants have been reviewed: Mexican, Italian, American, and Chinese food restaurants. There was a steady increase from the time Annie was born in 2002, upon visits with the rest of her family, but then as her own taste buds developed and her choices became more clear, her choices in restaurants began to fluctuate over time. The only time there was a consistent decrease in all types was in 2020 when COVID-19 shut down all restaurants and Annie’s ability to visit restaurants in person changed drastically.</p>

		<h2>The Number of Snapchats Kent Received During The Day</h2>

		<p class="byline">Whitney Wilson</p>
		
		<p>Yesterday, March 23, 2022, we tracked Kent’s incoming Snapchats he received throughout the day from his friends. The data shows that the number of Snapchats received tended to increase significantly around meal times (i.e. times where people tend to take breaks from work). Typically before and after meal times, his incoming Snapchats tended to decrease. However, Kent’s incoming Snapchats did increase after dinner. This was probably due to peoples’ tendency to go on social media at night when they are winding down for the evening and do not have any other obligations.</p>

		<p>To this day, we have never seen a perfect bracket. Yet still, every year, people are overly confident with how accurate their March Madness brackets will be. In a study that gathered data from many college basketball fans, an interesting discovery was made. From the tournament’s start date on Mar. 17, everyone’s confidence was a rollercoaster ride that ended up continuously decreasing. With historically great basketball programs falling to high-school sized Universities all around the country, many were left with their brackets completely obliterated before the Sweet Sixteen tips off today. (March 24th).</p>

		<p>A new study has found that, save for one psychopath, that people will eat soup mainly around the hours of 11am-1pm and 6pm-8pm. These are times that have been called by society, “lunch” and “dinner.” The other time, “breakfast” saw very little people eating soup. A potential cause for this trend is that society has designated these times as socially acceptable to eat.</p>

		<p>A new analysis of the various digital communications of a Syracuse University journalism professor reveals a disturbing correlation between the time of day, the use of the phrase of 'sounds good!' and a sharp decrease in patience levels in this particular academic, prompting concerns.</p>
		<p>On one particularly egregious evening, Husain mass-responded only the phrase 'Sounds good!' to several friends, family members and colleagues. In one case that night, a friend of more than 20 years had just informed the academic that he is getting married next year. On the same evening, Husain gave the same response to an irate editor who was requesting access to a belated story draft -- an email to which 'Sounds good!' would not, by any professional standards, be an appropriate response. </p>
		<p>"Sounds good!" responded Husain, in a frenzied rush to address all communications in a timely manner, and with patience levels dropping dramatically.</p>

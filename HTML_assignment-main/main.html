					<p>LONDON — Nurses across Britain went on strike on Thursday for the first time in the 74-year history of the National Health Service, underscoring critical challenges facing the long-revered system after years of underfunding and as the government contends with a burgeoning fiscal crisis.</p>
					<p>On a bitterly cold day, nurses and their supporters walked on picket lines in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, demanding a 19 percent pay increase and better working conditions that they say will make the profession more attractive and help address severe staffing shortages.</p>
					<p> “It’s been incredibly difficult,’’ said Melanie Denison, an intensive care nurse who worked in the N.H.S. for 25 years, as she picketed outside St. Mary’s Hospital in North London. Around her, a crowd of striking nurses, wearing hats and gloves and heavy coats, marched with signs that read, “Staffing shortages cost lives.”</p>
					<p>“The years since Covid have been the most challenging I have ever experienced,” she added.</p>
					<p>The government has said the pay demands are “unaffordable” and has pointed to recent pay rises and new funding plans for the health service as evidence of the government’s support.</p>
					<p>The strike reflects a growing discontent among health care workers, and many members of the public, over the degradation of service in recent years. The free health-care model that provided an egalitarian service for everyone in the country, regardless of income, has long been a national point of pride</p>
					<p>The 12-hour strike was the first of two planned walkouts, with another one scheduled for next Tuesday. Nurses were still staffing the most vital services, such as intensive care units and chemotherapy, dialysis and some pediatric services, but officials said non-urgent medical attention would be much less available. Hospitals and other health facilities say that they have tried to manage schedules to ensure the safety of patients during the action.</p>
					<p> The nursing strike is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/world/europe/uk-strikes-winter-discontent.html/">one of a series of job actions taking place across Britain this month</a> as sky-high inflation, rising interest rates and a recession put pressure on workers. Rail employees, airport baggage handlers and ambulance workers are among the others scheduled to stage walkouts over the next several weeks.</p>
					<p>The strike comes as the health service is in crisis, with declining working conditions for clinical staff amid the spillover pressures of the pandemic. There have been record delays for ambulance responses and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/26/world/europe/coronavirus-uk-nhs-backlog.html /">a major backlog for medical procedures </a>, among many other problems.</p>
					<p>Created in the aftermath of World War II, the National Health Service is one of the country’s most admired institutions, delivering treatment on the basis of need without money changing hands (with a few exceptions such as dentistry and medication charges).</p>

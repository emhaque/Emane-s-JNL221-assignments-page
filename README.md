This site will explain HTML and CSS concepts to students in Professor Husain's JNL221 course. It will also occasionally display student work.

## how to use this repo
-- You should open this entire folder in Sublime, and look at each page individually.  
-- Start with 'index.html'. This is considered the home page; when you go to jnl221.github.io, this page is what you see. The comments will explain to you what each tag means. <!-- Comments look like this. -->  
-- Then, go to 'index.css'. This is where the styles for the home page are defined, using classes and IDs. There are lots of different class properties you can use to change how things look, like font-family, color, font-size, border and margin.  
-- The other pages, '/section/one.html' and 'news221.html', are other pages on this website. Their styles are also defined by 'index.css' and the use the same HTML tags as 'index.html'. If you go to jnl221.github.io/sections/one.html or jnl221.github.io/news221.html, you see these pages, respectively.
